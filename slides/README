To compile your own set of slides:

1. You need a full-fledged Tex/Latex environment. 

1. Be sure to have downloaded all figures and unzipped the file 'figs-and-code.zip' 
   in the same directory as where 'makeslides.zip' was unzipped.

2. To compile a set of PDF slides for Chapter 03, type 'tools/makeslides.py 03 S'.

3. To compile a set of PDF handouts for Chapter 03, type 'tools/makeslides.py 03 H'.

The Python code as well as the file 'slidebase.tex' is fairly straightforward and can
be easily customized if wished.

Enjoy!
